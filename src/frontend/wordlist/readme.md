## Implementation Summary

I've created a comprehensive solution for managing wordlists in your application. Here's what's been implemented:

### 1. API Integration
- Added wordlist API methods to `api.js` to interact with the backend endpoints
- Implemented methods for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting wordlists

### 2. State Management with Context API
- Created a `WordlistContext` component that:
  - Loads wordlists from the backend when the application starts
  - Keeps wordlists in browser memory with an `_isDirty` flag to track changes
  - A background task runs every minute to check for dirty lists and sync only those changes
  - Saves changes when the app is closing using the `beforeunload` event

### 3. UI Updates
- Updated `ChatToolbar.jsx` to show wordlist status and match information
- Improved styling with updated CSS

### 4. Business Logic
- Added robust word matching using `normalizePhrase` and `areCloseMatches` functions
- Implemented error handling and optimistic updates for better UX
- Added methods for adding words to lists, moving words between lists, and creating new lists

### Usage Flow

1. The application loads and wordlists are fetched from the backend
2. Users can select text in chat messages to trigger the wordlist toolbar
3. Users can add selected text to an existing list or create a new one
4. Changes are stored in memory and immediately reflected in the UI
5. The application periodically syncs with the backend and also saves changes when closing

This implementation provides a seamless experience where users can manage wordlists without worrying about manual saving, while also ensuring data integrity through regular synchronization with the backend.
